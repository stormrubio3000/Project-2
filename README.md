# A Night's Tale


A Night's Tale is an interactive DnD Character Sheet used for character creation and maintinance based of DnD 5th edition.


# MVP:
A Player user will be able to pick from valid selection items to make a character. Their stats, feats, character background will
all be saved and easily accesible. They will be able to edit their inventory, action stats, and experience as they play.
This will allow a player to play DnD without needed to use pen and paper and still have full persistance. 

A Game Master user will be able to create characters as described above as well. This character will not be linked to their account though
as they will be able to edit their created characters and other players characters as needed. As well the DM will be able to place
characters in groups to display quest info to them together. A Game Master will be able to great custom options for games as well. 
This will include non-standard items and classes.



# Stretch Goals:
While the program is based on outside play and just helps the players and GM's track their changes we want to allow
for a type of single player expereience. GM's will be able to allow their groups a certain number of encounters or levels
that they can do outside of the normal campaign as solo adventures. These solo adventures will be automatiously generated 
and players will have small outings to collect loot, expereience, and fight monsters on their own.
